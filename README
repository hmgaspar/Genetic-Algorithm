Matlab Code:

The main code is the file ga_matlab.m.

Since Matlab does not accept function declaration in the main script, 3 more files need to be copied to the same directory:

roulette.m - function which performs a roulette wheel, ginven a vector of values and the total fitness.
invchr.m - function which performs the inversion of a position in the chromossome
x_function.m - function f(x). You need to modify this file to modify the function to be used in the code.

In the main code, the main parameters are:

Range of Values, with the maximum and minimum values for x
x_max = 32;
x_min = 0;

GA Parameters:
pop_size = 4; - Poulation Size
mutation_probability = 0.5; - Total probability of happen a mutation in a chromosome
number_of_generations = 20; - Number of Generations


Python Code

Similar to the Matlab one, except that the functions are defined inside the code.

The only file that you need to run is ga_python.py

You can get Ipython for windows in the website:
http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/

You may need an special library called "pylab" to plot the graphs:
http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

To run the code just type "run ga_python.py" in the comand line

The GA parameters are the same as in the Matlab example.
